# Adobe-Connect-Merger
This app helps to merge downloaded recordings from Adobe Connect recorded meetings with the precise timing and audio syncing
Points you should notice :
    1) temporarily, you should put the .py file where you have extracted the downloaded adobe file
    
    2) err on the side of caution if you don't know how to download an adobe recorded meeting, you can append /output/filename.zip?download=zip to the end of the link you are given by the institute or the meeting holder community.
